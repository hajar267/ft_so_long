🐍 so_long - 42 School Project

🧩 About the Project
so_long is a small 2D game project where the player moves around a map, collects items, and reaches the exit.
It introduces basic graphics handling using MiniLibX, as well as map parsing and simple game logic.

🎮 How It Works
You control a character on a tile-based map.
The goal is to:
✔ Collect all collectibles.
✔ Reach the exit.
✔ Avoid invalid moves (walls, closed exit before collecting everything).
The map is read from a .ber file.
